# Screengem

A simple Ruby implementation of the [Screenplay Pattern](https://ideas.riverglide.com/page-objects-refactored-12ec3541990). 

Screengem promotes writing step definitions in terms of actors, the tasks that the actor performs, 
and the questions that the actor asks. 

## Example Step Definitions

```ruby
Given("that they are signed in and viewing the {section_name}") do |section_name|
  actor.performs(task.sign_in, task.remember_signature_counter(section_name))
end

Then("their signature is captured") do
  actor.asks(question.signature_captured)
end
```

## Core Domain Model

An Actor asks questions and performs tasks.
An Actor is able to remember and recall key-value pairs.

A Question responds to answer.

A Task responds to perform.

## Actor Memory

Actors are able to remember and recall facts. This is the recommended way to pass state
between steps. To clear every actor's memory before each scenario add a hook:

```
Before do
  Screengem::ActorMemory.instance.clear
end
```

## Performing Tasks

Actors are able to perform tasks. A task may be implemented by interacting with domain services,
domain models, application databases, and the application via screen elements.

Capybara is available to all screen elements and is the recommended way to interact with a browser.

## Answering Questions

Actors are able to answer questions. A question is considered to be answered affirmatively
when no exception is thrown and negatively when an exception is thrown.

RSpec matchers are available to all questions and are the recommended way to implement a question.

## Dampening

It sometimes makes sense to slow down the automation. This is known as dampening.

To enable and configure dampening perform the following steps:

1. Create a sample dampening configuration `screengem generate --root features_screenplay`
1. Tweak the sample dampening configuration
1. Promote the sample dampening configuration `cp ./features_screenplay/dampen_configuration.yml.sample ./features_screenplay/dampen_configuration.yml`
1. Enable dampening `export APPLY_DAMPENING=1`

To stop dampening, run `unset APPLY_DAMPENING`

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'screengem'
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
